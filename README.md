# google-homepage
It's an attempt to copy the pure layout of Google homepage with no functionality besides hover. I wanted to try with no assistance after going through the tutorial of what I could remember. I didn't incorporate flex or media query because I didn't fully absorb those tutorials. I will try to update once I get a better understanding on those topics.
